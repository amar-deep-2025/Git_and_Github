# What is Git ?
Git is a version control system (VCS) that helps you track and manage changes in your code or files over time.

Think of it as a time machine for your projects- you can :

* Track changes (who managed what, when, and why)  
* Go back to an earlier version if something breaks  
* Work with others on the same project without overwriting each other's  work.
* Merge contribution from different people or branches.
